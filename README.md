# My personal collection of LTSpice components


Download the zip file and unpack the directory _PERSONAL and the files it contains to:<br>
%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sym\\<br>
Unfortunately, github adds a directory named "LTSpice-master" to the zip file.
The "_PERSONAL" directory is required because there are references to: "../sym/_PERSONAL/" in the .ASY files.<br><br>
In case you have trouble using these parts, please don't hesitate to create an "issue". I really appreciate to receive feedback from other LTSpice users.
