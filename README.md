# My personal collection of LTSpice components


Download the zip file and unpack the directory _PERSONAL and the files it contains to:
%USERPROFILE%\My Documents\LTspiceXVII\lib\sym\\_PERSONAL\\

Unfortunately, github adds a directory LTSpice-master to the zip file.

The "_PERSONAL" directory is required because there are references to
..\sym\\_PERSONAL\ in the .ASY files
